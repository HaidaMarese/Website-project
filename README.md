# Website Project â€“ Git Branching and Merging Practice

## About the Project

This project was created to practice using Git for collaborative work. The goal was to build a simple website while learning how to:

- Create and switch between branches
- Work on different features without conflicts
- Merge branches into the main project
- Fix merge conflicts
- Push work to GitHub

## Features Added

Each feature was built in its own branch:

- Navigation Bar (`feature/navigation-bar`)
- Footer (`feature/footer`)
- Hero Section (`feature/hero-section`)
- Contact Form (`feature/contact-form`)
- Testimonials Section (`feature/testimonials`)

## Steps I Followed

1. **Set up the repo**
   - Created a folder and initialized a Git repo
   - Added a basic `index.html` and made the first commit

2. **Worked on features**
   - Created a new branch for each feature
   - Made changes in `index.html`
   - Committed the changes

3. **Merged into main**
   - Switched to `main` branch
   - Merged feature branches one by one
   - Resolved any merge conflicts

4. **Pushed to GitHub**
   - Connected the local repo to GitHub
   - Pushed the main branch
